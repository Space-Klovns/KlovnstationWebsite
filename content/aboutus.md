Klovnstation 14 is a Space Station 14 server created as a response to the miserable situation of the game at large. 
Our goal is to create a game that is fun to play even if everyone is trying their best or doing what they want, and not a game where you have to self-police lest you eat a ban.

Our team is full of highly technical and skilled players, whose favor we have managed to accrue thanks to our powergaming and creativity friendly approach. The game design capabilities of Klovnstation run circles around any other Space Station 14 server thanks to the great community we have managed to gather.

While our server is now in its second, post-unjustified-dehub iteration thanks to past controversy, we are not going to give up on creating the best Space Station 14 server and codebase we can. Minimal rules and maximum freedom, that's the Klovnstation guarantee.

We hope that you have fun, and that you see why Klovnstation is **the place to be.**
